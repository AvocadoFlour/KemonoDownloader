Currently the program is very primitive.
You simply paste-in the link to the artist whose art you want to download.
If there is more than a single site available for a particular 
artist, e.g. both Pixiv Fanbox and Fantia, you need to do the process 
for the both of those.
Input just the zero-page link (without the "?o=" at the end).

If the folder inside of which you've placed 
the .exe hasn't got enough storage space, you input giberlish, etc. the program will just stop
